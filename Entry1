Symptom:
A functional test failing because of an element value not found displayed where
this element is result from mocked server response provided by Okhttp mockwebserver

Cause:
turned out to be because the api service was null and it has silently swallowing an
NPE 

How found:
- By putting breakpoints on all concerned method in the test ui fragment and specialy by
inspecting the values inside each field used.
- Inspecting and putting breakpoint in even the called libraries where the problem is related
   and is there 


Fix:

Fixed in file(s):


Caused by me:
Yes

Time taken to resolve bug:
4hrs (mostly to find where the issue is)

Lessons:

How could I have sped up finding this bug?
- Suspecting that the cause is it the recent made changes and putting breakpoints eveywhere
in the ui where the test is failing and inspecting the content of all the fields.
- Not getting frustrated and taking it as a learning opportunity.

Is it clear from the bug that it should have been caught in testing. If so, testing at which point â€“ unit, functional, system ?

What mistakes did I make in the code?
