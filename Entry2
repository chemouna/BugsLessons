Symptom:
ExceptionInInitializerError in a dagger provide module (specificaly for provideMonitoring )


Cause:
an NPE in a dependency of APIProvider which is used by Monitoring component and that dependency is JsonDeserializer
where it called getAsString on a null object.

How found:
By carefully reading and understanding possible causes what ExceptionInInitializerError is and when it can occur
in the java documentatio.

Fix:

Fixed in file(s):
An object json deserializer

Caused by me:
Yes

Time taken to resolve bug:
30mn

Lessons:
- Read the documentation of the exception class right away and always blame your own code first.

How could I have sped up finding this bug?
- By reading the documentation right away

Is it clear from the bug that it should have been caught in testing. If so, testing at which point â€“ unit, functional, system ?

What mistakes did I make in the code?
- not checking for null and edge cases

What were the assumptions that i've made that were wrong ?
- that the crash is cause by dagger somehow affecting the class loading not to be working

Actions:
- Read a lot more on Java Exceptions and their Semantics and their different types.
- See if a bug report to dagger is needed to make these kind of crash report more understandable and test on a small example
